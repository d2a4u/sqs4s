## Usage

*Limitation:* SQS HTTP API limits maximum message size of 256 KB and the message
body needs to be provided as URL's query parameter, hence: 

  - we cannot make use of streaming message as request's body 
  - the message should only has characters that are safe for URL encoding
  - you should always use HTTPS

However, it is good practice to keep message's size small since it should only 
contains references rather than data.

### Serializing Messages

Because of the limitation stated above, serialize is actual quite simple:

```scala
def serialize(t: T): String
```
Just need to make sure that the serialized String only contains URL encoding
characters.

Deserialize is:

```scala
def deserialize(s: String): F[T]
```

Where `F` is `F[_]: MonadError[?[_], Throwable]` to encapsulate error.

### APIs

#### Low Level

1-2-1 implementation of [SQS' API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html)

- CreateQueue
- DeleteMessage
- DeleteMessageBatch
- ReceiveMessage
- SendMessage
- SendMessageBatch

#### High Level

- `produce`: produce a message to SQS
- `batchProduce`: produce messages to SQS in batch operation
- `consume`: consume messages from SQS as a fs2 Stream, only acknowledge the message only when it has been processed
- `consumeAsync`: consume messages but making multiple calls to SQS in parallel
- `dequeue`: get messages from SQS as a fs2 Stream but acknowledge right away
- `dequeueAsync`: get messages but making multiple calls to SQS in parallel
- `peek`: peek for X number of messages in SQS without acknowledging them

## Examples

### Create Queue

```scala
val created = BlazeClientBuilder[IO](ec).resource
  .use { implicit client =>
    CreateQueue[IO]("test", sqsEndpoint).runWith(setting)
  }
  .unsafeRunSync()
```

### Produce and Consume

```scala
BlazeClientBuilder[IO](ec)
  .withMaxTotalConnections(128)
  .withMaxWaitQueueLimit(2048)
  .withMaxConnectionsPerRequestKey(Function.const(2048))
  .resource
  .use { implicit client =>
    val producer = SqsProducer.instance[IO, String](settings)
    val consumer = SqsConsumer.instance[IO, String](settings)
    // mapAsync number should match connection pool connections
    Stream.emits[IO, String](List.fill(10)("Test"))
      .mapAsync(128)(producer.produce)
      .compile
      .drain
      .flatMap(_ => consumer.dequeueAsync(128).take(10).compile.drain)
  }.unsafeRunSync()
```
